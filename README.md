### FILE ORGANISER

This program provides additional feature for current file manager by changing and organize to be easily found by humans

# Why this program?
For people who store huge datas on disk, and basically get those data(series, films) in bulk and from multiples providers, to avoid repetitives datas, and to make datas be manupilated easily, we have to organize data in a searchable way by human, 
It can be done by hand, but it's such a boring task that can take days if not weeks based on the amount of datas, 
So it makes to write a software once to do that every single time we want 

# What the sofware is supposed to do?
--> Index all datas, basically videos, audios, photos, and documents\n
--> Sorting thoses data using regular expressions, by author, eg: Grouping all musics of Diamond in one folder, grouping all the nigerians films in another folder\n
--> Creating folders by category, being able to distinguish datas and discover its category\n
--> Going further, so the program can know about the file, eg: Fast and furious 10 is a video, film of action, in VO, original version etc.\n
--> Remove duplicates of files, in order to free up space, Eg: Fally seul amour music exists in three or more resolutions, the program should store the highest resolution and then delete the others, if there copies of the same data, the program will only keep one of them\n
